The Prometheus Eco Racing Team App is a mobile application designed specifically for the members of the Prometheus Eco Racing team at NTUA. This app provides a platform for efficient and secure communication among team members, especially during emergency situations. It features an emergency button that enables instant communication and coordination during critical events.

Features
1. Emergency Button
The main functionality of the app is the emergency button, which serves as a quick and accessible way to initiate emergency communication. When the button is pressed, it immediately triggers a notification to all team members, alerting them of the emergency. This ensures that all relevant team members are promptly informed and can take appropriate action.

2. Emergency Notification
Once the emergency button is pressed, all team members who have the app installed on their devices receive an instant notification. The notification includes details about the nature of the emergency and its location, if available. Team members can then open the app to access further information and coordinate their response.

3. In-App Communication
The app provides a secure and private in-app communication channel for team members to exchange information during an emergency. Upon receiving an emergency notification, team members can open the app to access a dedicated chat feature. This chat allows real-time messaging between team members, enabling efficient coordination and decision-making.

4. Location Sharing
To enhance situational awareness and response coordination, the app supports location sharing. Team members can choose to share their real-time location with others in the chat. This feature helps identify the proximity of team members to the emergency location, enabling efficient resource allocation and assistance.

5. Team Member Directory
The app maintains a directory of all team members, along with their contact information. This directory ensures that every team member has the necessary contact details readily available, making it easier to establish communication in non-emergency situations as well.

6. Push Notifications
The app utilizes push notifications to ensure that team members stay informed and receive updates even when the app is not actively running. This way, important messages and emergency notifications can reach team members in a timely manner, regardless of their device usage.
